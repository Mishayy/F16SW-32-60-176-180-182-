Dear Teacher, </p>

<p>

I am writing this letter to tell you how happy I am to be in your class because you're the best teacher. This year has been hard but you helped in a very best way. <br>
Thankyou so much for being such a thoughtful and kind teacher. <br>
Your tutoring made a huge difference. I felt like I would never understand web development, but now I feel really very confident in this field. <br>
Thankyou again for being a great teacher. Allah bless you!
